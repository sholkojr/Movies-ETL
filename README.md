## Summary
Purpose of this project was to pull data from several sources (Kaggle, Wikipedia) and read them into a Pandas DataFrame. A function was developed to clean the data into a useable DataFrame.  Once the dataframe was cleaned, the data exported to a Postgres SQL database.  
This project was an introduction to regex to clean strings within a dataset and convert to numbers for dollar values and converting json data into Pandas DataFrames.
